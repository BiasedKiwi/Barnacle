HERE BE DRAGONS.

Hello fellow wanderer, I see you've stumbled upon this dark portion of the jungle that is 
Barnacle's codebase. I'm afraid you're going to have to continue this journey on your own.
But when this will be finished, it will be magical: An ideal world where ini, yaml, json files and maybe
others even will live in harmony. But for now, that world is still in development phase. So come back
later to see the advancement, or, if you're feeling adventorous, you can take a peek at the parser.py file.
Maybe read it, and enjoy some good spaghetti code. And maybe open a few issues about things that could be improved,
or maybe even contribute to the project!

Good luck, wanderer.
